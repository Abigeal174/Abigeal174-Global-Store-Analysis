# Global Superstore Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory and diagnostic analysis of the Global Superstore dataset using Power BI. The dataset contains detailed information on orders, customers, products, and regions, making it suitable for investigating profitability trends, sales performance, and operational challenges.

The analysis focused on uncovering patterns in sales and profit distribution across cities, countries, and product subcategories. Measures were created to evaluate profitability, highlight loss-making areas, and assess the impact of discounts and shipping costs on overall performance. Visualizations were designed to provide clarity and support decision-making.

## Approach
- Data was imported, cleaned, and modeled in Power BI.  
- Calculated measures were created to evaluate profitability at the city and subcategory levels.  
- Filtering techniques were applied to exclude cities with insufficient orders to ensure more reliable insights.  
- Visualizations such as bar charts, category breakdowns, and regional comparisons were used to highlight key trends.  
- Drill-down analysis was applied to connect profitability issues to underlying drivers such as discount levels and shipping expenses.  

## Key Insights
- Certain U.S. cities showed consistently low profitability despite significant sales volumes. High discounts and shipping costs were the main drivers of losses.  
- In Southeast Asia, some product subcategories generated persistent losses across multiple countries. Storage was identified as one of the weakest-performing subcategories in the region.  
- Shipping costs and discount policies were common themes in profitability challenges, particularly in competitive markets where margins are already thin.  
- Regions and subcategories with strong profit margins were identified, particularly within the technology-related product lines.  

## Recommendations
- Implement stricter discount controls by replacing uniform discounting with targeted promotional strategies.  
- Reassess logistics and shipping policies to reduce costs in low-margin regions.  
- Reposition or phase out product subcategories that repeatedly underperform in certain regions, particularly in Southeast Asia.  
- Allocate more resources toward high-margin products and regions to maximize profitability.  
- Continuously monitor profitability using automated Power BI dashboards to ensure timely interventions.  

## Conclusion
The Global Superstore analysis highlights the importance of looking beyond sales volume to understand true business performance. By focusing on profitability drivers such as discounting and shipping, and by tailoring strategies for different regions and product categories, the organization can strengthen its overall financial position and achieve sustainable growth.
